My first repository
Heyo peeps what's up?

I'm RagingWarrior and some of the things that you should know about me are that I love to read but playing games such as Terraria are what I like to do just that bit more. I have done coding for a bit but most of it has left me so I'm hoping that I can remember, with your help of course, what I was able to when I did coding for school.
